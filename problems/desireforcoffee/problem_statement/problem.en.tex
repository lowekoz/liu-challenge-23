\problemname{Desire For Coffee}
At campus Valla of Linköping University, the center of attention is the building Kårallen (the Coral). A number of sea turtles, inhabiting Kårallen, have been given an important task --- to deliver coffee to Lithe Kod, the hosts of Liu Challenge. Since Kårallen has its own café, the sea turtles have no problem getting their flippers on a few hot cups of Java, but Lithe Kod resides in a completely different building. Sea turtles live in water which means they cannot crawl efficiently on land and get tired quickly. They do however have a solution which allows them to crawl greater distances: stacking.\\
\\
Given $N$ sea turtles, where the $i$:th turtle can carry $C_i$ kg on top of its shell, weighs $W_i$ kg and can crawl $L_i$ meters (independent of weight carried), how far can the optimal turtle stack crawl?\\

\section*{Input}
The first line of input contains an integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 1000$), the number of sea turtles. Then follows $N$ lines, the $i$:th line ($1 \leq i \leq N$), describes turtle $i$ in the format '$C_i$ $W_i$ $L_i$' with ($1 \leq$ $C_i$, $W_i$, $L_i \leq 500$).

\section*{Output}
Output a single integer descriing the total crawl distance of the optimal turtle stack.
